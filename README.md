[00:11.62] Let's go outside, the snow is falling down
[00:14.68] And every child is having so much fun
[00:18.04] A snowman that's twice the size as me with a smile as quirky as mine
[00:23.78] We're holding hands to keep each other warm
[00:27.05] While we stand and watch the choir perform
[00:30.03] And all the Christmas songs that we love
[00:32.97] Yeah all the Christmas songs that we love
[00:53.47] 
[00:36.28] And in a while, we're gonna go inside and drink our chocolate by the fire
[00:41.95] 'Cause all I want is to spend this day with you
[01:05.45] 
[00:47.86] Let me give you a Christmas
[00:51.16] A moment we'll fill with love and joy
[00:54.35] Mmm mmm, so beautiful
[00:56.06] Kissing under mistletoes, baby with you
[00:59.42] Woo ooh, I don't need any presents
[01:03.39] As long as I spend this day with you
[01:06.53] Mmm mmm, so beautiful
[01:08.25] Kissing under mistletoes, baby with you, woo ooh
[01:32.25] 
[01:15.34] Making plans on what we're gonna do
[01:19.18] I feel so blessed that I can be with you
[01:22.53] 'Cause God knows that I've been longing for you
[01:25.82] Just wanna hold you close
[01:28.44] You know the stars are shining just for you
[01:31.50] Let's take a walk and we can follow the moon
[01:34.58] Let's say we reach a place, we can stay
[01:37.57] May we kiss a bit and dream away
[01:53.57] 
[01:40.52] And in a while, we're gonna go inside and drink our chocolate by the fire
[01:46.83] 'Cause all I want is to spend this day with you
[02:10.33] 
[01:52.42] Let me give you a Christmas
[01:55.61] A moment we'll fill with love and joy
[01:58.89] Mmm mmm, so beautiful
[02:00.41] Kissing under mistletoes, baby with you
[02:03.93] Woo ooh, I don't need any presents
[02:08.07] As long as I spend this day with you
[02:11.05] Mmm mmm, so beautiful
[02:12.83] Kissing under mistletoes, baby with you, woo ooh
[02:36.83] 
[02:30.12] And in a while, we're gonna go inside and drink our chocolate by the fire
[02:36.08] 'Cause all I want is to spend this day with you
[02:59.58] 
[02:41.89] Let me give you a Christmas
[02:45.00] A moment we'll fill with love and joy
[02:47.93] Mmm mmm, so beautiful
[02:49.66] Kissing under mistletoes, baby with you
[02:52.96] Woo ooh, I don't need any presents
[02:57.09] As long as I spend this day with you
[03:00.22] Mmm mmm, so beautiful
[03:02.08] Kissing under mistletoes, baby with you, woo ooh
